OCamlEditor is a source code editor and build tool for the OCaml
programming language.

It provides many features to facilitate editing code, accessing API
reference directly from the editor and compiling projects. It is entirely
written in OCaml and uses LablGtk for the graphical user interface; it is
light-weight, free and open source and runs under Linux and Windows.
