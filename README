OCamlEditor is a source code editor and build tool for the OCaml
programming language.

It provides many features to facilitate editing code, accessing API
reference directly from the editor and compiling projects. It is entirely
written in OCaml and uses LablGtk for the graphical user interface; it is
light-weight, free and open source and runs under Linux and Windows.

DEPENDENCIES

  * OCaml-4.01.0;
  * Lablgtk-2.18.0 (installed with Findlib);
  * Xml-light (installed with Findlib);
  * Findlib-1.4.0;
  * (optional) ocp-indent;
  * (optional) ocurl-0.6 to allow remote editing;
  * (optional) Dot command to display the module dependencies graph;
  * (optional) Lablgtk.rsvg to embed the graph viewer in the editor.

HOW TO COMPILE

  Change to the OCamlEditor toplevel directory and execute:

    ocaml build.ml ocamleditor

  Under Windows with MSVC execute:

    ocaml build.ml ocamleditor-msvc

  If the native code compiler is not available on your platform, compile with:

    ocaml build.ml ocamleditor-bytecode

  The name of the command is "ocamleditor.opt" (or "ocamleditor" if the
  native compilation is not supported), you can find it in the "src"
  directory.



INSTALLATION

  Beginning with OCamlEditor-1.9.0 installation paths have changed, so please
  uninstall the previous version first. You can do this with the command

    ocaml build.ml uninstall -ver-1.8.0 [-prefix <path>]

  To install OCamlEditor become superuser and execute:

    ocaml build.ml install [-prefix <path>]

  By default, commands will be installed under "/usr/local/bin", icons
  under "/usr/local/share/ocamleditor/icons" and plugins under
  "/usr/local/share/ocamleditor/plugins". You can specify an installation
  prefix other than "/usr/local" by giving an absolute file name as argument.

  Windows users may build an installer by compiling the included NSIS
  script, "ocamleditor.nsi". The free NSIS install system can be found at
  http://nsis.sourceforge.net



DEVELOPMENT

  The main page for development is hosted on the OCaml Forge, see the
  project's page:

    https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ocamleditor

  You can browse the source tree from:

    https://forge.ocamlcore.org/scm/browser.php?group_id=141

  or clone it by doing:

    git clone https://forge.ocamlcore.org/anonscm/git/ocamleditor/ocamleditor.git



INSTALLING Xml-Light WITH Findlib

  Since the Xml-Light distribution does not include a Findlib installer,
  you can do it yourself by following these notes:

  META
    version="2.2"
    description="Minimal Xml parser and printer for OCaml."
    requires=""
    archive(byte)="xml-light.cma"
    archive(native)="xml-light.cmxa"

  ocamlfind install xml-light META \
    xml-light.cmxa xml-light.cma \
    xml.mli xmlParser.mli dtd.mli \
    xml.cmi xmlParser.cmi dtd.cmi \
    xml.cmx dtd.cmx xmlParser.cmx \
    xml-light.a(lib)
