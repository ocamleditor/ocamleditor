Custom templates are a set of functions grouped into an OCaml library that
%s loads at startup. Each of these functions corresponds to a template
and is applied when the user invoke the template from the editor.
The type of a template function is <tt>string &#8594; string</tt>, where the argument is the
text currently selected in the editor and the result is the text that will replace
the selection.

To create a template write an OCaml module that implements such a function
and registers it with the main program. To register a function use
<tt><b>Template</b>.register</tt>, you can find it in the %s compiled
source tree. The signature of <tt><b>Template</b>.register</tt> is as follows:

<tt>  <b>val</b> register :
    <b>key:</b>string ->
    <b>descr:</b>string ->
    <b>f:</b>(string -> string) -> unit</tt>

Here is a simple example that surrounds the selection with double quotes.
File <tt>example.ml</tt>:

<tt>  <b>let</b> surround text = \"\\\"\" ^ text ^ \"\\\"\";;

  <b>let</b> _ = <b>Template</b>.register
    <b>~key:</b>\"example\"
    <b>~descr:</b>\"Description of example\"
    <b>~f:</b>surround;;</tt>

Compile with the command:

  <tt>ocamlc -a -o example.cma -I <i>~/ocamleditor</i>/src example.ml</tt>

where the <tt>-I</tt> option refers to the %s compiled source tree, so
replace it with the exact location that you have on your system.

Additionally, if you want your templates to be loaded only when you
open a specific project, you can copy the library in:

<tt>  %s</tt>

    About.program_name
    About.program_name
    (Filename.concat "<i>&lt;your-project-root&gt;</i>" Oe_config.template_project_filename);;
